The challenge was to take data from a csv file and insert it into a database.

The approach I took to solving this challenge was to retrieve data from the csv file
then format and insert it into a sqlite database.

The application is run in an IDE such as eclipse. All files should be in the same directory.

There are a couple alterations I considered, but the general
functioning of the application would be the same.
